I worked in a group with Allie Deabreau Liam Kelley Micheal Richardson Shea fitzgerald and victor ramirez for the 2nd part of this hw
and used the solution made by shea for those problems. I did the first part of the HW problems 1-5 entirely on my own with help from professor bianco. This was my first time working in a group and they had the 2nd part of the hw already done
when I joined so I did not contribute to the 2nd part. This is my first time submitting as part of a group please tell me if I did anything
incorrectly.
